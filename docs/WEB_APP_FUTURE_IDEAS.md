# Future Ideas (v2+)

1. **Agar.io Progression:** Active orb moves toward next as tasks complete. Leaves slime trail. At 100%, merges with next orb (accumulating mass). Validated as strong v2 concept.
2. **Pulse Ring:** Heartbeat ring expanding from active milestone every 3-4s.
3. **Progress Fill:** Nucleus fills with liquid like a beaker based on % completion.
4. **Cell Division:** Mitosis animation when completing a phase.
5. **Spore Trail:** Tiny static dots tracing path of completed phases.
6. **Nucleus Dot:** Darker organelle dot inside nucleus drifting toward next phase.
7. **Sound Design:** Subtle wet membrane sounds on clicks/drag.
8. **Locked Phase Visuals:** Spore/Seed state (small, dense) + Opacity Veil (frosted overlay).
9. **Background Organisms:** Large blurry depth-of-field blobs drifting in distance.
10. **Typography:** JetBrains Mono for specimen labels with bracket underlines.
11. **Organelle Icons:** Nucleus=Chat, Ribosome=Log, Mitochondria=Analytics.
